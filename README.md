## Project Description
In this project my ambition is to use >24h meteorological data to predict wind power generation for the next day. 
The intended use case is to assist a hypothetical energy company with planning their supply of power from a wind power farm connected to their network to optimize contingency supply solutions. 
By predicting near-future yield, the company will be better equipped to tackle potential shortages or to make the best of potential over-supply.

### About the dataset
This dataset is a unique compilation of field-based meteorological observations and wind power generation data, collected directly from one of our company's operational sites. 
The dataset represents a detailed hourly record, starting from January 2, 2017. 
This rich dataset provides real-world insights into the interplay between various weather conditions and wind energy production.
